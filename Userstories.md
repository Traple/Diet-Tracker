Development plan

I want to:

- [ ] Create a database connection for my Food Items section to enable food item management.
	- [ ] Add the option to add a new food item to the food items list, logging fats, carbs, proteins, kcals and price to the food items database after pressing the new food item button.
	- [ ] Add edit buttons attached to individual food items to change object properties.
	- [ ] Add delete buttons attached to individual food items to delete the entire object from both the screen and the database.
	- [ ] Add the option to insert a food item per 100 grams while creating a new food item.
	- [ ] Add the option to insert a food item per piece while creating a new food item, for example, 1 egg or 1 apple.
	- [ ] Insert a check after editing or deleting a food item. "Are you sure you want to ..".
	- [ ] Build a custom entry section to add name, kcals and other attributes to the date section without creating a new food item.
	- [ ] Rebuild the food items section into a table and by doing so, implement a sort function.

- [ ] Overhaul the 'Date' section.
	- [ ] Give this section the name 'Diary'.
